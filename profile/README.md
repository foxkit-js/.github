## About

Foxkit initially started as a collection of [utility packages](https://github.com/Mitsunee/foxkit/tree/main/packages/util#readme) and has since then expanded to a collection of packages, providing tools such as a [Linked List](https://github.com/foxkit-js/list) and a highly customizable [Logger](https://github.com/foxkit-js/logger) all with the goal of full TypeScript support out of the box.

The [Foxkit Library Template](https://github.com/foxkit-js/library-template), is a template repository with a complete setup for dual-published npm packages with TypeScript support and pre-configured tooling like ESlint, Prettier and Github Actions.
ESLint comes configured with the [Foxkit ESLint Config](https://github.com/foxkit-js/eslint-config-foxkit) which expands on recommended configurations by various plugins to provide a base configuration for modern development.
