## Projects

After previous experiments with a [monorepo] the project is moving back to the github org. All older repositories have been archived and projects will be migrated one-by-one. Some of the foxkit packages will receive full rewrites with many breaking changes. Here is an overview of migrated projects:

### eslint-config-foxkit

[eslint-config-foxkit](https://github.com/foxkit-js/eslint-config-foxkit) is a set of configuration helpers and rulesets for ESLint. The currently published version can be found in the [monorepo]. Starting with v3.0 we will migrate to ESLint 9-compatible Flat Configs.
